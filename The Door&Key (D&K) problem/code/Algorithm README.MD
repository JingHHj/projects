This is a README file for this algorithm

# TIPS:
# you can already find the existing result in "gif" folder and "result" folder

1. Run the  doorkey.py file you can get result for every case (both known and unknown)
    # After you run it you can see the gif result in the "gif" folder and the "result" folder

    #   functions:
    # partA_run_all(): run all the known cases at one time
    # partB_run_all(): run all the unknown cases at one time
    # partA(): run a known case 
    # partB(): run an unknown case 

2. the "gif" folder contains the .gif results for both known env (inside of the known folder) 
   and unknown env (inside of unknown folder)
3. the "result" folder contains the .jpg pic resultsboth known env (inside of the known folder) 
   and unknown env (inside of unknown folder)
4. the part1.py contains the code for part A
5. the part2.py contains the code for part B
6. the gif2jpg.py is a file that used for getting .jpg pics for everyframe in the .gif result
7. notes.md is only used for taking notes during coding
